## Abstract

The purpose of the security and systems subteam is to secure and maintain appropriate access
to the credentials and services/systems used by `conda-forge`. This infrastructure
includes all bot accounts, all service provider accounts, and all keys, API or otherwise,
used for various tasks. This team is also charged with provisioning new members of `core`
with access to the organization.


## Motivation

`conda-forge` maintains a lot of infrastructure both in terms of code but also
in terms of bot accounts, API keys for various services, and accounts on various
services (e.g., GitHub, DockerHub, etc.). This infrastructure has grown organically
over time to accommodate new needs and goals of the organization.

While nothing is a priori wrong with this mode of operation, it does limit our ability
to perform security maintenance tasks, like rotating API keys. It also makes it difficult to
provision new members of `core` with access to the organization. Finally, should parts
of the `conda-forge` infrastructure be lost or compromised, we currently have no
procedures in place to recover or re-secure them.

## Specification

The core responsibilities of this team are to

- maintain secure access to the credentials to all bot accounts
- maintain secure access to all keys, API or otherwise, used by `conda-forge`
- maintain secure access to all service provider accounts owned by `conda-forge`
- maintain the infrastructure for CFEP-13
- maintain automated ways to recover and reprovision `conda-forge` systems
- perform ongoing security maintenance tasks
- provision new members of `core` with access to all `conda-forge` systems, credentials
  and keys

This team will operate via the following rules

- only members of `core` can be on this subteam
- this subteam will report its activity to core at all `core` meetings
- this subteam will consult with core at `core` meetings regarding all planned activity
- this subteam will not limit the access by `core` members to any `conda-forge` resources
  including but not limited to its systems, credentials, keys, or service accounts
  
This team has a static charter and any member of core may join upon its creation.
