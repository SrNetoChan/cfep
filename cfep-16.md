## Abstract

This document proposes that we enforce the use of SPDX license expressions
in `license` field in package metadata and to hotfix the package metadata
to add the `license_family` field when missing by automatically
parsing the `license` field.


## Motivation

`license` field in package metadata is in different formats and it'll be
useful for automated tools to have the `license` field in one format.
We are proposing that the format be SPDX license expression format.

`license_family` field in package metadata gives a family of metadata,
but has only a few specific allowed values and until now has been the
field that automated tools have used. When `license` field is standardized,
this field becomes redundant and can be automatically inferred.


## Rationale - Why SPDX

SPDX.org has all OSI approved licenses, FSF approved licenses and a few
other commonly used licenses.

SPDX also has a mechanism to use custom licenses using the
`LicenseRef-[0-9a-zA-Z\-.]*` format.

For packages with multiple licenses, SPDX license expressions provide
the conjunctions `AND` and `OR` to combine them.

SPDX format also has parsers to parse the format which makes it easy
to validate and also to infer details like the `license_family` field.
